# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Initializing the Memory Bank from the design.md document.
- Capturing project requirements, architecture, technology, and workflow context.
- Preparing for implementation: scaffolding docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and Python app structure.

## Recent Changes

- Memory Bank files created: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md.
- All core context extracted from design.md and documented in memory-bank/.

## Next Steps

- Scaffold infrastructure files (docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, requirements.txt).
- Implement Celery app, tasks, and orchestrator logic as described in design.md.
- Set up Flower UI and verify end-to-end Saga workflow.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Using orchestration-based Saga with explicit compensation for rollback.
- All services containerized for reproducibility and ease of deployment.
- Single Postgres instance for all tasks (simplified for PoC).
- Optional FastAPI for HTTP-triggered orchestration.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- saga_id used for traceability in all tasks and logs.
- Logging and monitoring prioritized for debugging and demonstration.
- Docker Compose as the primary orchestration tool.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Celery and Flower provide sufficient primitives for Saga orchestration and monitoring.
- Explicit compensation logic is required for rollback; no built-in distributed transaction support.
- Docker Compose simplifies multi-service setup and teardown.
