# Progress

## What Works

- Memory Bank initialized from design.md.
- All core context files created: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md.
- Project requirements, architecture, and technical context are clearly documented.

## What's Left to Build

- Scaffold infrastructure files: docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, requirements.txt.
- Implement Celery app, tasks, and orchestrator logic.
- Set up Flower UI and verify Saga workflow execution.
- (Optional) Add FastAPI service for HTTP-triggered orchestration.

## Current Status

- Project is in the documentation and planning phase.
- Ready to begin infrastructure and code scaffolding.

## Known Issues

- No implementation or configuration files exist yet.
- No automated tests or CI/CD setup.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Chose orchestration-based Saga pattern for explicit control and compensation.
- Decided on single Postgres instance for simplicity.
- Prioritized traceability (saga_id), logging, and monitoring for demonstration and debugging.
