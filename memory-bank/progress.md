# Progress Log

## Recent Milestones

- Initial implementation of Saga orchestration with Celery, Redis, and PostgreSQL.
- Added Flower for real-time monitoring of task execution.
- Docker Compose setup for all core services.
- Implemented compensation logic for robust rollback on failures.
- Added optional FastAPI endpoint for triggering Sagas.
- Refactored orchestrator and tasks for clarity and maintainability.

## Integration Testing and Validation

- Introduced automated integration test workflow using `docker-compose.test.yaml`.
- Created a dedicated integration test container that depends on all core services.
- Tests are defined in the `tests/` directory and mounted as a volume into the test container.
- Added helper script (`scripts/integration-tests.sh`) for running tests locally.
- Updated documentation (README, memory-bank) to describe test workflow and validation requirements.
- Established project rule: all code changes must be validated by running the integration test suite before merging or deployment.
- Added Cline rule file `.clinerules/testing-and-validation.md` to formalize testing and validation guidelines.

## Next Steps

- Expand integration test coverage to include more complex workflows and failure scenarios.
- Automate test execution in CI/CD pipeline.
- Continue to update documentation and rules as the project evolves.
