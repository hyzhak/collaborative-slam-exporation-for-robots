# Progress Log

## Recent Milestones

- Added RedisInsight service for Redis Streams visualization; verified running at http://localhost:8001.
- Initial implementation of Saga orchestration with Celery, Redis, and PostgreSQL.
- Added Flower for real-time monitoring of task execution.
- Docker Compose setup for all core services.
- Implemented compensation logic for robust rollback on failures.
- Added optional FastAPI endpoint for triggering Sagas.
- Refactored orchestrator and tasks for clarity and maintainability.

## Integration Testing and Validation

- Introduced automated integration test workflow using `docker-compose.test.yaml`.
- Created a dedicated integration test container that depends on all core services.
- Tests are defined in the `tests/` directory and mounted as a volume into the test container.
- Added helper script (`scripts/integration-tests.sh`) for running tests locally.
- Updated documentation (README, memory-bank) to describe test workflow and validation requirements.
- Established project rule: all code changes must be validated by running the integration test suite before merging or deployment.
- Added Cline rule file `.clinerules/testing-and-validation.md` to formalize testing and validation guidelines.

## Next Steps

- Scaffold Redis Stream monitor container in docker-compose.yml.
- Write integration tests for:
  • Orchestrator trigger on Redis event.
  • Task event emission.
  • Orchestrator as Celery Canvas workflow.
- Execute TDD cycle for each test suite.
- Update Memory Bank and commit after each feature.
