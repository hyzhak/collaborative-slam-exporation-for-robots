## Brief overview

- Guidelines for maintaining clarity, non-duplication, and actionable context in Memory Bank files for this project.
- Project-specific rules for updating, consolidating, and referencing Memory Bank sections.

## Memory Bank structure and consolidation

- Avoid duplicating actionable "Next Steps" across multiple Memory Bank files; maintain a single authoritative source (preferably in activeContext.md).
- Use progress.md exclusively for completed milestones and integration/testing validation logs.
- Update activeContext.md for current work focus, next steps, and active decisions.

## Update workflow

- After completing a milestone, move it from "Next Steps" in activeContext.md to "Recent Milestones" in progress.md.
- Remove or update outdated or completed items from "Current Work Focus" and "Next Steps" to reflect actual project state.
- Commit Memory Bank changes with Conventional Commits-compliant messages.

## Communication and review

- When in doubt about duplication or context, clarify with the user before making structural changes.
- Document only actionable, current, or completed items; avoid speculative or redundant entries.

## Other guidelines

- Ensure all Memory Bank edits are precise, concise, and reflect the latest project reality.
- Use markdown formatting and clear section headings for all updates.
